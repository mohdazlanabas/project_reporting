Attn: Management Team

Dear Grenviro Solutions Team,

net1io.com proposes to design and build a Site Daily Report System to replace your manual landfill reporting process with a secure, auditable, and cloud-ready application. Our goal is to deliver faster data capture, higher data quality, and immediate visibility across your facilities.

What we’ll deliver

Web app with secure login and role-based access (Ops, QA, Management).
Daily report capture aligned to your existing templates: site, date, operation hours, manpower, equipment status, activities (operations/LTP/projects/others), rainfall, forecast, LTP discharge, tonnage breakdown, notes, and photo uploads.
Past report search and retrieval with filters (site/date), attachment access, and export-ready data.
PostgreSQL data store with auditability; API-first architecture for future mobile app integration.
Cloud-ready deployment (Google Cloud Run + Cloud SQL + Cloud Storage) with environment-based configuration and CI/CD pipelines.
Admin setup for sites, dropdown vocabularies, and user provisioning.
Security: JWT auth, hashed passwords, storage isolation for uploads, HTTPS-ready deployment.
Implementation approach

Discovery and alignment: confirm fields, dropdown vocabularies, and roles; map current manual PDFs to structured data.
Build: Node.js/Express backend, PostgreSQL schema, secure file handling; modern web frontend for desktop/tablet use.
QA and UAT: walkthroughs with your team, refinement of validations and exports.
Deployment: containerized release to GCP (or your preferred environment), with runbooks and handover.
Timeline

2 weeks: Discovery and UX mockups.
4 weeks: Build core features (auth, reporting, listing, attachments, exports).
2 weeks: UAT, hardening, and go-live support.
Total: ~8 weeks from kickoff.
Investment

Fixed project fee: RM 50,000.
Includes build, testing, deployment assistance, and knowledge transfer. (Cloud hosting costs are excluded and billed directly by the provider.)
